- Discord bot joins my server
- Goes through every message ever, appends this data to a .csv file (message with what, date, time)
- Provides following info in terminal/console:
   - Hour with most 'what'
   - Day with most 'what'
   - Year with most 'what'
   
   - Week of month with most 'what'
   - Season with most 'what'
   
   - Continue / add more stuff here
 - This information is then graphed in a visual program, data per category will be in /outputs each in their own folder
 - will contain rendered pngs of the graphs, table data, etc
